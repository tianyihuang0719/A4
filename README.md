(NOTE: Although Canvas has the ability for you to add a comment when you submit your summary I WILL NEVER READ THOSE COMMENTS! Make sure that everything you want me to read is INSIDE this executive summary file!)

Assignment name: 
TCSS 305: Programming Practicum, Autumn 2024

Name: Tianyi Huang
UWNetID: huangtyi


Assignment Overview:
(Describe your understanding of the purpose and scope of the assignment in 250 words or less. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over. Do not just copy text from the assignment description.)

This project involves building a city traffic simulation using object-oriented programming principles, specifically focusing on inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes. My main task is to design and implement various vehicle classes, such as Truck, Car, All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), Bicycle, and Human. Each vehicle has distinct movement behaviors, collision rules, and terrain traversal capabilities. Also by using the GUI that professor gave me, I am able to use GUI to displays vehicle movements, and collisions.

Resources and Collaborations:
(List all resources used during the development of this assignment other than materials published on Canvas or found in the course Java reference book.
Also list the names of any students whom you collaborated with during the development of this assignment.
If you only used materials from Canvas and the course Java reference and did no collaboration with others during this assignment you can just say 'none' below.)

NONE.


Technical Impression:
(Describe what you have done to complete the assignment in 200-500 words. The word count is not strict, so don't worry about going slightly over; however, summaries that do not meet the minimum length requirement or are trivial in nature (representing little thought or effort) will not get full credit. You can share your personal experiences, things that particularly frustrated you about the assignment, things that particularly interested you about the assignment, etc. It is especially important that you document any difficulties you had with tools, Java libraries, etc.)

I did not manage my time well, I am on my business trip this week, I should have started this project earlier. I only got this program run correctly, but did not get a chance to clear all the warnings. I will manage my time better next time. 


Unresolved problems in my submission:
(Use this space to list problems which you know exist in your submission. This could include program features which you did not have time to implement, bugs in your code, warnings generated by the tools which you did not understand or did not have time to correct, or other issues. I give a reduced grade penalty for problems which I find in your submission that are listed here and a larger penalty for those which are not. Just say 'none' if there are no issues that you are aware of.) 

There are a bunch of warnings that I did not get a time to clear them. I will manage my time better to make sure have time to do this part...


Questions:
(Use this space to ask questions that you still have about the assignment, or just say 'none' if you have no questions at this time.)

NONE
